# Synod AI Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge
As contributors and maintainers of **Synod AI**, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free and professional experience for everyone, regardless of experience level, gender identity, or technical background.

## 2. Technical Integrity & Responsibility
Given that Synod AI is used in **UAV and Robotics environments**, our conduct extends to the quality of our contributions:
* **Accuracy:** We do not knowingly commit code or data that misrepresents telemetry or sensor facts.
* **Safety First:** We prioritize system stability. We do not "move fast and break things" when it concerns flight safety logic or hardware-to-software interfaces.
* **Transparency:** We are honest about the limitations and error rates of our AI models.

## 3. Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being respectful of differing technical viewpoints (e.g., Rust vs. Python design patterns).
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism on PRs.
* Focusing on what is best for the safety and performance of the community.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior
* The use of sexualized language or imagery.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.

## 5. Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## 6. Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with additional clauses specific to the **Synod AI Robotics Team**.
